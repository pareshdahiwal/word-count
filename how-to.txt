How to execute Word Count program?

Step 1:- Please make sure JDK/JRE 17 is installed on your machine and ""<JDK/JRE_DIR>\bin" is set in the path environment variable

Step 2:- Download the project "WordCount" and extract if it is in compressed file format.

Step 3:- Copy the file you want to check in the project directory.
E.g.
If project directory "WordCount" is inside the directory "C:\workspace" and your file is "sample.txt",
then copy "sample.txt" inside the directory "c:\workspace\WordCount\".

Step 4:- Open command prompt and navigate to the project directory
E.g.
If project directory "WordCount" is inside the directory "C:\workspace",
then command prompt should be navigated till "C:\workspace\WordCount>"

Step 5:- In the file explorer, copy the file in the project directory

Step 6:- Run command -> java -jar word-count.jar "{fileName}"
E.g.
If your file name is "sample.txt", java -jar word-count.jar "sample.txt"

For sample output, I have kept a file called "word-count-sample-1.txt" in project directory level,
on command prompt execute the command - java -jar word-count.jar "word-count-sample-1.txt"
